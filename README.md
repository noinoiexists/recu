### Overview

This is the source repository for my personal website [Recu](https://recu.blog).
All published content on the site originates from markdown files in this repository.

Recu is simply an experiment - a place to set down some of those thoughts whenever I feel like it, and to see how they change with time.

The folder structure of this repository is designed to serve as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault, making it easy to write, think, and refine posts in a local knowledge environment.



### Repository Structure

- `.obsidian/` – Obsidian configuration, community plugins, and workspace state

- `posts/` – All Markdown posts (one per file)

- `images/` - Images used on the website

- `templates/` – Templater-compatible starter templates for writing new posts



### Contribute
Although Recu began as a personal website for myself, I believe that an _exchange_ of thoughts is necessary for clarity. That’s what the ’e’ in Recu stands for. I accept guest authors on this website. If you carry a thought that’s taken time to mature, you are welcome to bring it here.

You can add posts to Recu either by directly making a pull request on GitHub **or** by visiting [recu.blog/publish](https://recu.blog/publish/).
