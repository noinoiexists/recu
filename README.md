### Using the Obsidian Vault

You can use this repository as an Obsidian vault for longform thinking and writing. Ideal for contributors who prefer writing with local context and are comfortable with the Obsidian environment.

- Style settings have been configured to mimic the actual website

- Plugins like **Templater** are pre-configured

- Vault can be opened directly after cloning
 





### Writing Guidelines

- Make sure to read the [guidelines](https://recu.blog/publish/) on the website before submitting
- Do not use any Obsidian-specific code (such as wikilinks, dataview, etc.) in the markdown as they will not be rendered
- Using the full website url is preferred while creating links. However, if you wish to link posts within the repo locally, do not use the `.md`. For example, to link to post-1.md, use `[](post-1)`. 
- HTML is supported
